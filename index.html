        <p>It all happens automatically. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. It takes dark in order to show light.</p>
        <p>Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We must be quiet, soft and gentle.</p>
        <p>Take your time. Speed will come later. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.</p>
